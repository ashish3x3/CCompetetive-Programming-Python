 '''
Given an array  consisting of  elements and an integer . Count the number of subarrays of array  which has maximum element greater than K.

Count the total number of subarrays which has maximum element â‰¤ K. Lets call this count X.
Subtract the above count  X from the total number of subarrays i.e ((N*(N+1))/2)      .

Chase in this question is to calculate the value of  which can be easily calculated by removing 
all the elements > K  from the array A  and counting the total number of subarrays form from the elements left in the array A.

Author's solution makes use of the approach described above.


A[1,2,3]
It has 6 subarrays :

{1}, {2}, {3}, {1,2}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}
I think that for a vector of N elements the total number of subarrays is N*(N+1)/2.

Complexity:
time complexity is O(N)

space complexity is O(1)

Execution:
You do not actually need to construct all the sub-arrays, as they reduce to only one element. You also can ignore all sub-arrays, that do not contain elements E > K. I also observed that there are x*y sub-arrays that match the above specified criteria for each element E > K. X is the distance from E to any previous e > K. Y is the distance from E to the end of the array. This way you crate all the sub-arrays that contain E and are not part of another e.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/py
def numberList(a ,k):
    result = 0
 
    last_biggest = -1
    a_len = len(a)
 
    for idx in xrange(a_len):
        if a[idx] > k:
            result += (idx-last_biggest)*(a_len-idx)
            last_biggest = idx
 
    return result
 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(raw_input())

        n,k = map(int, raw_input().split())
        a = map(int, raw_input().split())
        print numberList(a ,k)
