'''
Complexity:
time complexity is O(n^2 * m^2)

space complexity is O(1)

More optimized solution are below

This is simply checking from each starting point for n*m pattern matrix...
like if 1,2 matches with 0,0 of pattern and follwing all mact in that row, next row to check wiill be 2,1 directly and not 2,0. i.e we check directly below the first match element in next rows and not entire row.

Execution:
There are many sophisticated 2d pattern matching algorithms out there. Just think of computer vision, robotics, gamingâ€¦ The issue with most of them is, that they are rather heuristics than complete matches. I first started solving this challenge by using brute force and well.. It passed the time constraints. I did not expect that. If anyone has a good way of reducing the number of subarray checks, please post it in the comments!

SubArray-Check reduction techniques:

keep the sum of the sub-array in a separate grid, check only if sum matches the pattern
Rabin-Karp string searching algorithm on each line to fast forward

There are 2 approaches demonstrated here.
One is the C++ Program which does an element by element match for the smaller array in the larger 2D and breaks as soon as there is a mismatch.
The second one is a short but tricky Ruby script which uses a regular expression based approach to search for the smaller pattern inside the larger one. It will be an interesting exercise for the reader to brainstorm on how and why it works!
