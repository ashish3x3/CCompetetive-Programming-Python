For a sum of two numbers to be evenly divisible by k the following condition has to hold. If the remainder of N1%k == r then N2%k = k-r for N1+N2 % k == 0. Let us calculate the set of all numbers with a remainder of r and k-r and pick the larger set. If the remainder is half of k such as 2 % 4 = 2 or exactly k such as 4 % 4 = 0, just one number from each of these sets can be contained in Sâ€™.
