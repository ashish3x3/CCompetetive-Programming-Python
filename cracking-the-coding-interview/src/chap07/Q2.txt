/*There are three ants on different vertices of a triangle. What is the probability of
collision (between any two or all of them) if they start walking on the sides of the
triangle? Assume that each ant randomly picks a direction, with either direction
being equally likely to be chosen, and that they walk at the same speed.
Similarly, find the probability of collision with n ants on an n-vertex polygon.*/

P(clockwise)=(1/2)^3,
P(counterclockwise)=(1/2)^3,
so P(same_direction)=P(clockwise)+P(counterclockwise)=1/4,
so P(collision)=1-P(same_direction)=3/4.

P(clockwise)=(1/2)^n,
P(counterclockwise)=(1/2)^n,
so P(same_direction)=P(clockwise)+P(counterclockwise)=(1/2)^(n-1),
so P(collision)=1-P(same_direction)=1-(1/2)^(n-1).
