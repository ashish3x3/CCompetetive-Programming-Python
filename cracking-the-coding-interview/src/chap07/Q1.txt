/*You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play one of two
games.
Game 1: You get one shot to make the hoop.
Game 2: You get three shots and you have to make two of three shots.
If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of p should
you pick one game or the other?*/

Game 1: 
P(game1) = p

Game 2: 
P(game2)=P(make 1 and 2) + P(make 1 and 3) + P(make 2 and 3) + P(make 1, 2 and 3)
        =p*p*(1-p) + p*(1-p)*p + (1-p)*p*p + p*p*p
        =3p^2 - 2p^3

play Game 1 if:
   P(game1) > P(game2)
=> p > 3p^2 - 2p^3
=> p(p-1)(2p-1) > 0 note that 0<=p<=1
=> p < 1/2

If p = 0 or p = 1/2 or p = 1, then it doesn't matter which game to play.
