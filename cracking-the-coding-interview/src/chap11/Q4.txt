Imagine you have a 20 GB file with one string per line. Explain how you would sort
the file.

SOLUTION:
Divide the file into chunks which are x megabytes each, where x is the amount of
memory we have available. Each chunk is sorted separately and then saved back to the
file system. Say we now have N chunks. Once all the chunks are sorted, we then merge 
the chunks one by one according to the following algorithm:

1. Divide your memory into (N+1) parts. First N data parts are used for reading data 
from N chunks, the last one is a buffer.
2. Load data to fill the first N data parts from N chunks respectively, perform an 
N-way merge sort to the buffer.
3. While each data part is not empty, perform the sort. If any data part is empty, load
new content from the according chunk.
4. While the buffer is not full, perform the sort. If the buffer is full, write buffer
to the disk, clear buffer.
5. Repeat step 3-4 until all N chunks are empty.

At the end, we have a fully sorted file.
This algorithm is known as *external sort*.
