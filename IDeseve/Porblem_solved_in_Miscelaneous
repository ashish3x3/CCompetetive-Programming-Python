Implement a fair coin from a given unfair coin
Event 1: Probability of HEADS coming up in both is P*P = P2
Event 2: Probability of TAILS coming up in both is (1-P)*(1-P) = (1-P)2
Event 3: Probability of HEADS coming up in first and TAILS in second is P*(1-P)
Event 4: Probability of TAILS coming up in first and HEADS in second is (1-P)*P
If you observe carefully, you would notice that events #3 and #4 occur with equal probability of P*(1-P).
Now let us design a System where we keep generating events until we get 3rd or 4th event, and then return value which comes up in the first flip of that event. In another words, keep flipping the unfair coin two at a time, until they come up with different values, then return value of first flip of the coin (out of the two flips). Here is a code snippet for this system.
boolean flip1;
boolean flip2;
do { flip1 = f(); flip2 = f(); } while (flip1 == flip2)

we use bayes theorm to preove prob of heads and tail in this syatem is 1/2.
Probability of getting HEADS in this system = Probability of getting HEADS in the first flip given that two flips resulted in different values.
Probability of getting TAILS in this system = Probability of getting TAILS in the first flip given that two flips resulted in different values.
A = Getting HEADS in the first flip
B = Getting different values in the 2 flips
We need to find the probabilities P(A), P(B) and P(B|A).

P(A)    = Probability of getting head on flipping a coin = p

P(B)    = Probability of getting HEADS in first flip and TAILS in second flip
                                    OR
                         getting TAILS in first flip and HEADS in second flip
        = Probability of Event 3 + Probability of Event 4
        = p*(1-p) + (1-p)*p = 2p(1-p)

        P(B|A)  = Probability of getting different values in both flips given that first flip is HEADS
        = Probability that second coin is TAILS
        = (1-p)

How many step combinations to get up x number of steps?
if n<=2 return n...
else f(n-1) +f(n-2)...
thisd can also be done using fibnocci series..iterativly
