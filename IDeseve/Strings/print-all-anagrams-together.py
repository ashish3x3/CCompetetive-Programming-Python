'''
Let us understand the steps with following input Sequence of Words:

"cat", "dog", "tac", "god", "act"
1) Create two auxiliary arrays index[] and words[]. Copy all given words to words[] and store the original indexes in index[]

index[]:  0   1   2   3   4
words[]: cat dog tac god act
2) Sort individual words in words[]. Index array doesnâ€™t change.

index[]:   0    1    2    3    4
words[]:  act  dgo  act  dgo  act
3) Sort the words array. Compare individual words using strcmp() to sort

index:     0    2    4    1    3
words[]:  act  act  act  dgo  dgo
4) All anagrams come together. But words are changed in words array. To print the original words, take index from the index array and use it in the original array. We get

"cat tac act dog god"

# A Python program to print all anagarms together
 
# structure for each word of duplicate array
class Word(object):
    def __init__(self, string, index):
        self.string = string
        self.index = index
 
# Create a DupArray object that contains an array
# of Words
def createDupArray(string, size):
    dupArray = []
 
    # One by one copy words from the given wordArray
    # to dupArray
    for i in xrange(size):
        dupArray.append(Word(string[i], i))
 
    return dupArray
 
# Given a list of words in wordArr[]
def printAnagramsTogether(wordArr, size):
    # Step 1: Create a copy of all words present in
    # given wordArr.
    # The copy will also have orignal indexes of words
    dupArray = createDupArray(wordArr, size)
 
    # Step 2: Iterate through all words in dupArray and sort
    # individual words.
    for i in xrange(size):
        dupArray[i].string = ''.join(sorted(dupArray[i].string))
 
    # Step 3: Now sort the array of words in dupArray
    dupArray = sorted(dupArray, key=lambda k: k.string)
 
    # Step 4: Now all words in dupArray are together, but
    # these words are changed. Use the index member of word
    # struct to get the corresponding original word
    for word in dupArray:
        print wordArr[word.index],
 
# Driver program
wordArr = ["cat", "dog", "tac", "god", "act"]
size = len(wordArr)
printAnagramsTogether(wordArr, size)

Time Complexity: Let there be N words and each word has maximum M characters. The upper bound is O(NMLogM + MNLogN).
Step 2 takes O(NMLogM) time. Sorting a word takes maximum O(MLogM) time. So sorting N words takes O(NMLogM) time. step 3 takes O(MNLogN) Sorting array of words takes NLogN comparisons. A comparison may take maximum O(M) time. So time to sort array of words will be O(MNLogN).
